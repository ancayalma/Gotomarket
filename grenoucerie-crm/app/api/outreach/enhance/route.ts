- Highlight market opportunity
- Include traction metrics if mentioned
- Be comprehensive but concise (300-500 words ideal)
- Use compelling, confident language without being overly salesy

CRITICAL RULES:
1. KEEP all the populated values in the template (like specific names, companies, products, briefings)
2. Only use placeholders for LEAD-SPECIFIC data that changes per recipient:
   - {LEAD_NAME}, {LEAD_COMPANY}, {LEAD_TITLE}, {LEAD_EMAIL_USERNAME}, {LEAD_TYPE}, {LEAD_LOCATION}
   - {COMPANY_RESEARCH} (this is auto-gathered per lead)
3. DO NOT replace populated values with placeholders like {USER_NAME} - keep the actual values!
4. Improve the voice, structure, and requirements to be more compelling
5. Make the prompt more industry-specific and targeted
6. Add creative personalization requirements

Example of what TO DO:
- If the template says "You are John Smith", keep it as "You are John Smith"
- If it has product briefing text, keep that actual text

Example of what NOT TO DO:
- DO NOT replace the user's actual name with "{USER_NAME}"
- DO NOT replace the user's actual company with "{COMPANY_NAME}"
- DO NOT replace the actual briefing content with "{PROJECT_BRIEFING}"

Return ONLY the improved prompt template text, ready to use.`;

- Company: ${context?.companyName || "See template"}  
- User: ${context?.userName || "See template"}
- Campaign Name: ${context?.campaignName || "Outreach Campaign"}
- Number of Leads: ${context?.leadsCount || "Multiple leads"}

Improve this prompt to:
1. Have a more unique and compelling voice/persona specific to this product
2. Add more detailed requirements for personalization
3. Include industry-specific angles if applicable
4. Make the output requirements more precise
5. Add creative hooks and CTA suggestions

REMEMBER: Keep all the actual values (names, companies, briefings) - only use {LEAD_*} and {COMPANY_RESEARCH} placeholders for per-lead data!`;
