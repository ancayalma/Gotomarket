/**
 * POST /api/outreach/prompt/compose
 * Body: {
 *   personaName?: string;
 *   projectRole?: string;
 *   goalKeywords?: string; // short description or keywords, to be expanded
 *   projectId?: string;    // optional, to resolve project briefing
 *   leadId?: string;       // optional, to resolve assigned project from lead
 * }
 *
 * Returns: { prompt: string }
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Composes a fully fleshed, project-aware outreach PROMPT TEXT using seed inputs.
 * - The inputs are used as seeds; the model must expand and elaborate the Goal and context,
 *   rather than simply copying seed strings verbatim.
 * - The returned text is a prompt intended to be used by another generative model to produce the email.
